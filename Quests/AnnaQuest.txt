Your horse's hooves pound the weathered stone path as you approach a new town.
You slow your horse to a walk as you enter the town, passing a large statue of some mighty hero, arm held high with a sword.
A large name is on the front of the statue, 'Pete'.
Once you enter town, you spot a few buildings.
Where would you like to go?
