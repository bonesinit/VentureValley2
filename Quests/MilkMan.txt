Henry is so happy! :) So excited you're helping him!
He tells you he has two suspects. 
Suspect 1: Barthalomew Sampson, noted animal theif.
Suspect 2: Rudolf Wiggum, well-respected potion maker.
!
Tell me about Barthalomew.
Tell me about Rudolf.
Visit Barthalomew.
Visit Rudolf.
?

// Scene 1: Tell me about Barthalomew.
1
He tells you that Barthalomew is a noted animal theif,
con man, adulterer, magician, murderer, tax evader, and pro
lute boarder.
You ask him why they still let him live there. 
He shrugs and says "Hey, he's pretty good on a lute board."
!
Ok
?

// Scene 2: Tell me about Rudolf.
2
He tells you that up until recently, Rudolf's potions have been 
pretty weak. But not long after Henry's cow was stolen, Rudolf 
starting selling new calcium pills.
You ask him how skeletons can take pills.
He tells you they take them the same way they drink milk.
!
Ok
?

// BARTHALOMEW PLOTLINE ==================================================================

// Scene 3: Visit Barthalomew (Return if Ask Bart about cow, shake bart down for answers). 
3
You arrive at Barthalomew's cave. 
There's a lot of big spikes outside and signs that say "Keep Out!", "No Girls Allowed",
and "Eat My Tunic!".
He seems like a pleasant enough guy.
How are you going to go about this?
!
Ask him about the cow.
Violently ask him about the cow.
Sneak in without him seeing you and look for the cow.
!

[Charisma] Sweet talk it out of him.

_4
[Bard] See if you can appeal to his sense of Rock n' Roll.
?

// Scene 4: Ask Bart about the cow. 
4
You yell into the dark cave asking about the cow.
A rock flys out of the darkness and hits you on the head.
There's a note attached to it. In childlike scrawl it says,
"I doN't have a Cow, man! >:("
!
Well that was useless.
?

// Scene 5: Violently ask Bart about the cow. 
5
You walk into the cave like you own the place and see
Barthalomew the skeleton pretending to eat a roasted duck. 
"I'm Barthalomew Sampson, who the hell are you?"
You're worst frickin' nightmare, kiddo.
How are you gonna do this?
!
Slap the duck out of his hands and shake him down for answers.
Stab him now and find the cow later. 
!
@
_6
[Strength] Indimidate him with your muscles.
?

// Scene 6: Shake Bart down for answers.

"Hey, I stole that!" 
You have a fierce struggle, but he gets the best of you 
and kicks you out.
!
Aw man :( 
?

// Scene 7: Stab him and look for the cow
7
You straight up stab this guy and he dies.
No one will ever witness his lute boarding (or be robbed/murdered)
again. You look through all of his stuff but don't find any cow. 
You do find half a reciept though. 
!
Take the reciept and report back to Henry.
?

// Scene 8: Intimidate him with your muscles
8
Someone had better call a doctor because thesE PUPPIES ARE SICK!
Barthalomew all but soils himself and starts spilling the beans.
He tells you that him and Rudolf stole and sold the cow to some guy, 
but he only has half the reciept. 
He tells you some lute-boarding tips, since you're so cool.
!
Nice! Take the reciept and report back to Henry.
?

// Scene 9: Sneak in without him seeing you and look for the cow
9
You look around but don't see a cow around. 
Maybe there's something else here?
!
No there isn't.
!
@
_4
[Luck] Yes there is.
?

// Scene 10: Found receipt while sneaking.
10
Awesome! You found half a receipt for the sale of the cow. 
You also find some illegal fireworks! Don't mind if I do!
!
Report back to Henry.
?

// Scene 11: Sweet talk it out of him.
11
You walk in spouting some story about being a broom salesman.
You compliment Barthalomew on his choice of decor (a lie) and tell him
you're a crime memorobilia collector (half truth). You ask him if he has
any proof of a crime and he gives you a half a reciept and some illegal fireworks.
!
Report back to Henry.
?

// Scene 12: Rock n' roll it out of him.
12
You sing some song about stealing a cow into the cave entrance. Barthalomew comes out
and joins you and during the chorus you two have a lovely duet about how he sold the cow 
and how the only proof he has is half a reciept, which he waves in the air like a lighter.
You clock him in the face, grab the reciept, and run.
!
Report back to Henry.
?

// Scene 13: Report back to Henry
13
You return to Henry's variety of goods with the reciept. He excitedly takes the reciept from you.
He points out half a name cut off by the rip. Rudolf's signature is on the bottom of the reciept. 
!
Pay Rudolf a visit.
?

// RUDOLF PLOTLINE ---------------------------------------------------------------------

// Scene 14: Visit Rudolf
14
You walk across the street to Wiggum's Apothecary.
There's a little chimney coming out of the roof expelling green sparkly smoke.
It smells like... frogs?
!
Walk in and strike up a conversation.
I bet if I ransack the place I'll find a cow somewhere. 
Maybe if I climb down that chimney I can sneak in.
!
#
_1
[Reciept] Confront him with the receipt.
?

// Scene 15: Strike up a conversation.
15
You walk in ready to lay down the law on this guy, but before you know it you're walking
out again with arms full of useless bone-related potions.
!
Let's try that again.
?

// Scene 16: Ransack the place.
16
You run in and start throwing things around, desperately looking for the cow.
Since its a two room hut, it's not long before you've turned the entire place over.
Rudolf whips you with a pair of eels until you leave.
!
Okay so that didn't work.
?

// Scene 17: Sneak in down the chimney.
17
You climb up to the roof by moving a few crates into a staircase. Unfortunately, ladders haven't
been invented yet. Thomas Ladder needs to hurry up.
You climb into the chimney and slide down with ease. 
You land directly into a cauldron full of a green potion, which thankfully is a potion that heals 
burns, because its boiling over a fire.
!
Get out of the cauldron!
You know, this is kinda nice. Maybe I'll just relax...
!
#
_6
[Shaman/Druid] Hey wait a second... this tastes a little milky...
?

// Scene 18: Get out of the cauldron.
18
You get out of the cauldron, soaked from head to toe in green goo. 
!
Alright, lets Scooby Doo this and scare the crap out of this guy.
?

// Scene 19: Scooby Doo
19
You walk into the main room waving your arms around like you're the green tar man.
"I'm the green tar man!" you say.
Upon seeing you, Rudolf drinks an Overdramatic Suicide Potion and faints to the ground.
You hold him. "In my last confession... I want to give you this half of a receipt. I stole a cow.
That was really bad of me." He re-dies in your arms. 
!
Nice!
?

// Scene 20: Sleep in the cauldron.
20
You fall asleep in the cauldron and have pleasant dreams.
You wake up to yelling when Rudolf discovers you and he whips you with eels until you leave.
You've slept worse.
!
Let's try another approach.
?

// Scene 21: Taste the potion.
21
You taste to potion and suddenly... you Know. You know this potion was made from the milk of Henry's
cow. You know Rudolf and Barthalomew were just pawns for a mysterious benefactor. You know that there
is proof in the form of half a receipt in the chest on the other side of the room. 
!
Yoink! I'll take that and go back to Henry.
?

// Scene 22: Confront him with the reciept. 
22
You march right in there and confront Rudolf with the receipt. He starts to cry and tell you a sob story
about how he needed to do it for his business. Yeah yeah, that's what they alllll say. You ask him for the 
other receipt half and he obliges.
!
Return to Henry.
?

// Scene 23: Return to Henry
23
You return to Henry's variety of goods with the reciept. He excitedly takes the reciept from you.
He points out half a name cut off by the rip. Barthalomew's signature is on the bottom of the reciept. 
!
Pay Barthalomew a visit.
?

// Scene 24: Both receipt halves found. 
24
You've found both receipts! Henry lines them up reads the name to you. "Guard T. Boney". Henry describes
him to you and you recognize that he's the guard who confiscated your horse. 
!
Let's go visit the guard, Guard.
?

// RESCUE COW PLOTLINE -----------------------------------------------------------------

// Scene 25: Arrival at Guard's house.
25
You arrive at Guard the guard's residence. Almost as if I totally forgot this town is supposed
to be full of skeletons and only remembered right now, Guard is the only skeleton who lives in 
a mausoleum. The place looks locked up tight.
!
Create a commotion and try to draw him out.
Break in. 
!
#
_1
[Illegal Fireworks] Kaboom? Kaboom.
?

// Scene 26: Create a commotion
26
Alright, how are you going to draw this guy out?
!
Yell, I guess?
Bang on the door like a maniac.
?

// Scene 27: Yell, I guess.
27
You start yelling incomprehensible babble. You babble so much it starts to feel normal to you and 
then you get really scared because the babbling feels like what it felt like to be sane. You question
reality. You also started chopping a tree with a sword at some point, probably thinking it was 
conspiring against you. It falls and lands on the roof of the mausoleum, creating a big hole.
!
That's convenient, let's head in!
I kinda wanna keep being insane.
?

// Scene 28: Bang on the door like a maniac.
28
You bang on the door oh so angrily but nobody answers :( Kind of sad. Makes you think.
!
Aww :(
?

// Scene 29: Head in
29
You climb into the big hole in the roof of the mausoleum. If everyone in this town is a skeleton, does
that mean this is kind of like a church for them? You ponder whether or not you have violated the Geneva
convention as you drop in. Inside it's actually pretty quaint. Lots of nice curtains and doilies and all that.
The cow is in the corner, cowering, and the guard is standing there menacingly with an axe.
!
Try to talk him down.
Try to beat him up.
!
#
_5
[Necromancer] Haha, dumb dumb built his home on my UNDEAD ARMY.
@
_3
[Intelligence] Convince him that this is totally useless and doesn't make sense at all.
#
_1
[Big Rock] Hit him in the face with that big rock.
?

// Scene 30: Keep being insane.
30
You do that for a little bit longer but the fun wears off eventually. While your rambling and raving you do
find a big rock though.
!
Cool I'll take that.
?

// Scene 31: Break in
31
You try to break in, but this place is locked up tight.
!
:( :( :( :( 
?

// Scene 32: Blow it up
32
Finally, those fireworks are going to come in handy. You place them all around the mausoleum and light them.
With a big, satisfying, KABOOM! the mausoleum disappears into a ball of fire. When the smoke clears you see a
cow and a skeleton standing where the mausoleum once was, blackened with soot. The cow is fine and starts to 
wander out, but the skeleton coughs and breaks into a thousand pieces. 
!
Get the cow and get my reward! >:)
?

// Scene 33: Try to talk him down
33
He can't be bargained with... 
He can't be reasoned with...
He doesn't feel pity, or fear, or remorse...
And he absolutely will not stop...
Until you are dead...
!
Alright, violence it is then.
?

// 34: Try to beat him up / Violence it is
34
You fight feircely, but in the midst of the battle someone accidentally cuts the cow in half, longways.
Its a supernatural cow though, so of course its still alive, but the halves are both off doing their own thing now.
The guard is a skilled fighter and you realize you won't be able to best him.
As an alternative you offer him half of the cow, and he accepts your offer.
!
Return to Henry with half of the cow.
?

// 35: Necromancer get him with your undead army
35
Dozens of skeletal arms shoot out from the ground and drag the screaming guard down to the depths. Those are actually
his in laws who he has been avoiding seeing, so like, it's personal. Rest is piece, ya jerk.
!
Take the cow and get back to Henry.
?

// 36: Int. Convinve him this makes 0 sense
36
You ask him why he even needs a cow or what the point of this is. Honestly, he's not quite sure either. 
You ask him how milk would even benefit a skeleton without a body to digest it. 
His head explodes like an orange.
!
Alright. Guess I'll just bring this cow back to Henry.
?

// Hit him with a big rock
37
This is it. Congratulations. I am so, so proud of you. You found the true ending to this quest! As the guards skull
splinters under your blows you have a feeling like someone just slipped a few special gems in your pocket. 
That's me. I slipped a few special gems in your pocket.
!
Let's take the cow and get out of here!
?

// QUEST REWARDS -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 38: Half cow
38
You return to Henry with the cow. He is over the moon until the cow turns the face him head on.
Still, he takes it better than most would, but only gives you half the reward (since you only
brought him half a cow). 
You got: Boots of kicking.
!
Sweet! I'm going back to town.
?

// 39: Full cow
39
For returning his cow Henry gives you two items!
You got: Boots of Kicking and The Wand of Speedrunning.
!
Sweet! I'm going back to town.
