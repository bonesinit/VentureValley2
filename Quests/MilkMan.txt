He tells you that Barthalomew is a noted animal theif,
con man, adulterer, magician, murderer, tax evader, and pro

Ok

He tells you that up until recently, Rudolf's potions have been 
pretty weak. But not long after Henry's cow was stolen, Rudolf

You ask him how skeletons can take pills.
He tells you they take them the same way they drink milk.

Ok

You arrive at Barthalomew's cave. 
There's a lot of big spikes outside and signs that say "Keep Out!", "No Girls Allowed",
and "Eat My Tunic!".
He seems like a pleasant enough guy.
How are you going to go about this?

You yell into the dark cave asking about the cow.
A rock flys out of the darkness and hits you on the head.
There's a note attached to it. In childlike scrawl it says,
"I doN't have a Cow, man! >:("
!
Well that was useless.
?

// Scene 5: Violently ask Bart about the cow.

You walk into the cave like you own the place and see
Barthalomew the skeleton pretending to eat a roasted duck. 
"I'm Barthalomew Sampson, who the hell are you?"
You're worst frickin' nightmare, kiddo.
How are you gonna do this?

Slap the duck out of his hands and shake him down for answers.
Stab him now and find the cow later.

You straight up stab this guy and he dies.
No one will ever witness his lute boarding (or be robbed/murdered)
again. You look through all of his stuff but don't find any cow. 
You do find half a reciept though.

Take the reciept and report back to Henry.

// Scene 8: Intimidate him with your muscles

Someone had better call a doctor because thesE PUPPIES ARE SICK!
Barthalomew all but soils himself and starts spilling the beans.
He tells you that him and Rudolf stole and sold the cow to some guy, 
but he only has half the reciept. 
He tells you some lute-boarding tips, since you're so cool.

Nice! Take the reciept and report back to Henry.

// Scene 11: Sweet talk it out of him.
11
You walk in spouting some story about being a broom salesman.
You compliment Barthalomew on his choice of decor (a lie) and tell him
you're a crime memorobilia collector (half truth). You ask him if he has
any proof of a crime and he gives you a half a reciept and some illegal fireworks.
!
Report back to Henry.
?

// Scene 12: Rock n' roll it out of him.
12
You sing some song about stealing a cow into the cave entrance. Barthalomew comes out
and joins you and during the chorus you two have a lovely duet about how he sold the cow 
and how the only proof he has is half a reciept, which he waves in the air like a lighter.
You clock him in the face, grab the reciept, and run.
!
Report back to Henry.

// RUDOLF PLOTLINE ---------------------------------------------------------------------

// Scene 14: Visit Rudolf
14
You walk across the street to Wiggum's Apothecary.
There's a little chimney coming out of the roof expelling green sparkly smoke.
It smells like... frogs?
!
Walk in and strike up a conversation.
I bet if I ransack the place I'll find a cow somewhere. 
Maybe if I climb down that chimney I can sneak in.
!

[Reciept] Confront him with the receipt.

You walk in ready to lay down the law on this guy, but before you know it you're walking
out again with arms full of useless bone-related potions.
!
Let's try that again.
?

// Scene 16: Ransack the place.
16
You run in and start throwing things around, desperately looking for the cow.
Since its a two room hut, it's not long before you've turned the entire place over.
Rudolf whips you with a pair of eels until you leave.
!
Okay so that didn't work.
?

// Scene 17: Sneak in down the chimney.
17
You climb up to the roof by moving a few crates into a staircase. Unfortunately, ladders haven't
been invented yet. Thomas Ladder needs to hurry up.
You climb into the chimney and slide down with ease. 
You land directly into a cauldron full of a green potion, which thankfully is a potion that heals 
burns, because its boiling over a fire.
!
Get out of the cauldron!
You know, this is kinda nice. Maybe I'll just relax...
!

[Shaman/Druid] Hey wait a second... this tastes a little milky...

// Scene 19: Scooby Doo
19
You walk into the main room waving your arms around like you're the green tar man.
"I'm the green tar man!" you say.
Upon seeing you, Rudolf drinks an Overdramatic Suicide Potion and faints to the ground.
You hold him. "In my last confession... I want to give you this half of a receipt. I stole a cow.
That was really bad of me." He re-dies in your arms. 
!
Nice!
?

// Scene 20: Sleep in the cauldron.
20
You fall asleep in the cauldron and have pleasant dreams.
You wake up to yelling when Rudolf discovers you and he whips you with eels until you leave.
You've slept worse.
!
Let's try another approach.
?

// Scene 21: Taste the potion.
21
You taste to potion and suddenly... you Know. You know this potion was made from the milk of Henry's
cow. You know Rudolf and Barthalomew were just pawns for a mysterious benefactor. You know that there
is proof in the form of half a receipt in the chest on the other side of the room. 
!
Yoink! I'll take that and go back to Henry.
?

// Scene 22: Confront him with the reciept. 
22
You march right in there and confront Rudolf with the receipt. He starts to cry and tell you a sob story
about how he needed to do it for his business. Yeah yeah, that's what they alllll say. You ask him for the 
other receipt half and he obliges.
!
Return to Henry.
?
