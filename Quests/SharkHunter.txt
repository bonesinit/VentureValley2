You walk down to the steps to the basement. It's totally

You jump in the water and start stabbing the shark. 
A human corpse wearing a cardboard shark fin floats to the

You call out the "shark" for its poor use of carboard and 
crayons. You don't know how this get up would fool anybody.
He comes out and explains he is the owner's brother and he's
just having a rough time and trying to get some attention.

Okay... I'm gonna go get my reward.

You bring the guy in the basement up to talk with the bartender.
They have a lovely heart to heart conversation and reunite.
While they're reuniting you steal their wallets.

You tell the bartender about the body in the cellar. She suddenly
gets very serious and tells you it was probably her brother
looking for attention. She tells you she's going to have to go 
make defleshing arrangements, so she can only spare a nickel.
