There is no sun in this dastardly, monochromatic hamlet. For all these hapless chimps know, the smog hugs up to every edge of the world.
Two guards, awkwardly clad in chainmail stand guard outside the dilapidated city gate. They look really sad- wow, everyone does. This is actually really sad.
Fortunately, you happen to speak chimp and can understand them when you approach, even through their thick Brooklyner accents.
"De city is currently on lockdown. Yuh with me? Nobody is allowed in or out. Ya' dig? Come back in a week! Okay?"

Wait a few days in a nearby hamlet.

You spend a few nights at a tavern in a surprisingly lively farmtown just a few hours away.
The rowdy, energetic chimps here drink and sing shanties which keep you up at night.

Ignore it.
Make them shut the heck up!
